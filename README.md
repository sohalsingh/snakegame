# snakegame

This is a simple implementation of the Snake Game in Python using the Pygame library. The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a growing snake, trying to eat food while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.

## Game Controls

- Use the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to control the snake's direction.
- Try to eat the food (represented by a red block) to make the snake grow longer.
- Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body, as it will lead to game over.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## How to Run the Game

1. Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your machine.
2. Download or clone the project source code.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the game using the command: `python snakegame.py`.
5. Play the game using the arrow keys.
6. When the game is over, close the game window or press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the code:

- Adjust the `width` and `height` variables to change the game window size.
- Modify the colors to change the appearance of the snake and food.
- Change the game speed by adjusting the `clock.tick()` value.

## Dependencies

- Pygame: `pip install pygame`
